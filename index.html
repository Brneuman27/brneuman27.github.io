    <h1>A Guide to Tinkercad Architecture</h1>
    <h2>Why would anyone in their right mind make this?</h2>
    <p>When I started architecture 2 years ago I heard about Revit, also known as the most widely used architecture software around. But when I saw that the software was over $1,000 I decided I didn't want to learn how to use it.</p>
    <p>So instead of spending the time to learn Revit I used a web based software designed for engineering called Tinkercad.</p>
    <p>Now if you're like me you might have heard of Tinkercad or used it before, but if you haven't, don't worry, it's very easy to pick up and learn in a few minutes. Although, this should be more than enough for you to learn how to use Tinkercad effectively.</p>
    <p>Here are just a few of the buildings I've made in Tinkercad:</p>
    <div class="designs">
    <img src="Mockbee.png" alt="A tan house with 2 brown slanted rooftops">
    <img src="Classroom.png" alt="A tall white and blue building">
    <img src="DreamHouse.png" alt="A tan 3 story house with brown triangular rooftops">
    <img src="NotMysteryShack.png" alt="A tall dark brown house with a long dark grey rooftop">
    <img src="OrangeRoof.png" alt="A large tan house with broght orange triangular rooftops">
  </div>
  <p>The first thing I do before starting is figure out what I want this building to contain, be it 3 stories, a front yard, or a few white plastic lawn chairs. A good way to do this is to ask friends or family for an outline for the house.</p>
