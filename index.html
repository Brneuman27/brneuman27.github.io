    <h1>A Guide to Tinkercad Architecture</h1>
    <h2>Why would anyone in their right mind make this?</h2>
    <p>When I started architecture 2 years ago I heard about Revit, also known as the most widely used architecture software around. But when I saw that the software was over $1,000 I decided I didn't want to learn how to use it.</p>
    <p>So instead of spending the time to learn Revit I used a web based software designed for engineering called Tinkercad.</p>
