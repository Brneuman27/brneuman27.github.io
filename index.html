    <h1>A Guide to Tinkercad Architecture</h1>
    <h2>Why would anyone in their right mind make this?</h2>
    <p>When I started architecture 2 years ago I heard about Revit, also known as the most widely used architecture software around. But when I saw that the software was over $1,000 I decided I didn't want to learn how to use it.</p>
    <p>So instead of spending the time to learn Revit I used a web based software designed for engineering called Tinkercad.</p>
    <p>Now if you're like me you might have heard of Tinkercad or used it before, but if you haven't, don't worry, it's very easy to pick up and learn in a few minutes. Although, this should be more than enough for you to learn how to use Tinkercad effectively.</p>
    <p>Here are just a few of the buildings I've made in Tinkercad:</p>
    <div class="designs">

    <img src="Classroom.png" alt="A tall white and blue building">
    <img src="DreamHouse.png" alt="A tan 3 story house with brown triangular rooftops">
    <img src="NotMysteryShack.png" alt="A tall dark brown house with a long dark grey rooftop">
    <img src="OrangeRoof.png" alt="A large tan house with broght orange triangular rooftops">
  </div>
  <p>The first thing I do before starting is figure out what I want this building to contain, be it 3 stories, a front yard, or a few white plastic lawn chairs. A good way to do this is to ask friends or family for an outline for the house.</p>
  <p>For this website I'm going to talk about my most recent project, the house with the orange rooftops on the far right.</p>
  <p>This is the floorplan for the house that I plan on teaching you all to make</p>

  <ol>To start, I mess around with my settings. Mainly these few bits: </ol>
  <li>making the units read in millimeters and having the build plate be 256mm x 256mm. I chose those numbers because the build plate of my 3d printer is 256 mm x 256 mm.</li>
  <li>Next I place a red box and think about what room I want to build off of. For this house I chose to build off my living room in the center</li>
  <li>Once you place the box and think about what you want to make it and also A. how big it should and B. how should the other rooms connect to the center room.</li>
