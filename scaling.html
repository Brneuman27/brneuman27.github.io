    <h1>Welcome to Scaling 101</h1>
    <p>For properly scaling objects Google is your best friend. Finding the general size of an object through Googling is very helpful for proper room sizing. Say you're making a laundry room, you can either Google the averge size of a luandry room or make a custom size based on what you want inside the room. I wanted a washing machine and a dryer so I scale my room to properly fit both of those at the back wall.</p>
    <img src="LaundryWashing.png" alt="The floorplan of the laundry room with a washing machine and dryer">
    <p>The two grey rectangles are the washing machine and dryer</p>
    <p>Following the interior scaling for all your rooms you should end up with a floor plan that looks similar to mine, this floorplan can then scaled up and have a roof placed on it to look like the exterior of the house.</p>
